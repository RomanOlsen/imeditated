    <p>I started meditating using apps such as Medito. The guided sessions really grew on me, but as time went on, I noticed a problem. I wanted to keep up my “streak” of meditations in their app, as I found daily practice to be highly beneficial, but I also now wanted the option to meditate differently - whether using a different tool or just not relying on my phone.

Most habit trackers I found online are great, but meditation was really the only habit I actually wanted to track daily.

That’s how I led to imeditated.com. It’s my accountability friend for a habit that truly keeps me grounded. </p>
