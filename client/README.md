I meditated.com

// TODO 
consider how we want the login process. Do we want the home page to actually be imeditated.com/dashboard? and imeditated.com is the landing? How do we want to handle the dashboard if the user is not logged in? Redirect them?

Disable the button until authenticated? With a message and arrow saying to log in to begin using it?

We may need CodeWorks' help later for this.
